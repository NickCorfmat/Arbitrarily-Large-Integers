DESCRIPTION
``` 
This program implements the BigInteger ADT to perform computations on large numbers.

```
FILES
```
+ `List.h` Header file containing the interface for the List ADT.
+ `List.cpp` C++ file containing the List ADT.
+ `ListTest.cpp` C++ file containing code for testing the List ADT.
+ `BigInteger.h` Header file containing the interface for the BigInteger ADT.
+ `BigInteger.cpp` C++ file containing the BigInteger ADT.
+ `BigIntegerTest.cpp` C++ file containing code for testing the BigInteger ADT.
+ `Arithmetic.cpp` Contains the main() function that performs operations on BigInteger objects.
+ `Makefile` Supports the compilation of all the .cpp programs in the pa6 directory.
+ `README.md` Contains information regarding the files in the pa6 directory and how to run them.

```
BUILD
``` 
To build, run `make` on the terminal command line within the pa6 assignment directory followed by `Arithmetic`, `BigIntegerTest`, and/or `ListTest`. This creates respective executable files which can then be run.
```
CLEAN
```
Running `make clean` will remove all the executable (.o) files from the pa6 assignment directory as well as other compiler-generated files.
```
RUNNING
```
To run, type `./Arithmetic` followed by an input and output file.
